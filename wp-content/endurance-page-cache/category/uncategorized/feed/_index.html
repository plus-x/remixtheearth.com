					<h3><span class='et-dropcap'>W</span>hen I told my family &amp; friends that I was traveling to Colombia, the first question asked was: Is it safe to travel in Colombia? Well, if any of you have been reading the news this year you’ll know that Colombia’s President Santos was awarded the 2016 Nobel peace prize for his efforts to secure a deal with the Farc to end their part in a 53-year armed conflict. The United Nations certified that more than 7,000 guerrillas had turned over their weapons. A similar peace agreement is now being sought with the other rebel fighters, the ELN. So, peace is here, &amp; it’s real! For most of my life, I have heard stories about Colombia, mostly of cocaine, killings &amp; essentially civil war between the government &amp; rebel groups. Well, things are changing now &amp; tourism is here in a major way. This country is absolutely stunning in its natural beauty, from the beaches on the Caribbean to the snow capped peaks of the Sierra Nevada Cocuy Mountains. Despite its relatively small size, Colombia is the second most biologically diverse country on Earth, home to about 10 percent of the world&#8217;s species. This biodiversity results from Colombia&#8217;s varied ecosystems—from the rich tropical rainforest to the coastal cloud forests to the open savannas. I aim to be here 6 months, quite possibly stay as an expat 1+ years if I fall more in love with this amazing country (I’m almost there)! So far, I’ve been here in Bogota one month, initially thought to just spend five days here. I am thoroughly enjoying the friendly people, nightlife, amazing restaurants at even more amazing prices ($3usd for 5 course meals), the incredible murals &amp; graffiti art all over that tops even NYC in style! La Candelaria neighborhood has been my home base, which I highly recommend. It is the oldest part of Bogota &amp; famous for its cobblestone streets, over 80 hostels, museums &amp; views of the stunning mountains just up the street. While many residents complain about Bogota’s chilly mountain air &amp; traffic jams, Bogota is the beating pulse of everything in Colombia. Here you find the best of what Colombia has to offer. As more tourism has arrived &amp; security increased in the city, Bogota is now more entrepreneurial then ever before! Below you can read about my take on the music scene, vegetarian restaurants &amp; more. Disfruta Bogota!</h3>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>:: MUSIC &amp; NIGHTLIFE :: </strong></h2>
<h3><strong> </strong></h3>
<h3>During the weekends you can find everything from swinging salsa bars with live bands, traditional Afro-Colombian music with gaitas (flutes), cumbia, rock n’ roll, jazz &amp; of course many DJ’s pumping reggaeton &amp; current electronic music! If you’re a guy, you will soon see why Colombian women are considered the most beautiful womenin the world, up there with Brazilians. And, you better learn some Latin dances, because they like to dance! The three main party districts are La Candelaria, Chapinero &amp; La Zona T (also known as La Zona Rosa). Club entry varies in price.  If your an early bird &amp; not into the nightlife so much, head to Carerra 7, aka La Septima, in La Candelaria on Sundays 8am-2pm where they close the streets off to cars &amp; have bands, performance art &amp; vendors.</h3>

<h3><strong>How to Renew Your Colombian Tourist Visa:</strong></h3>
<h3>There are two ways to extend the initial 90 day tourist visa to reach the 180 day limit. One way is to leave the country, for example, by traveling by road to Ecuador or Venezuela. When you re-enter Colombia you will simply be issued with another 90 day tourist visa. The alternative method of visa renewal is to apply for one at the local office of Immigration Affairs (IA). A branch of IA is located in each of the county&#8217;s major cities. In <a href="https://latintravelguide.com/bogota">Bogota</a>, the office is situated at Calle 100 #11-27, and in <a href="https://latintravelguide.com/medellin">Medellin</a> the address is Calle 19 #80A – 40, Barrio Belén. A full list of centers is available via the <a href="http://www.migracioncolombia.gov.co/">immigration office’s website</a>. <a href="https://latintravelguide.com/colombia/tourist-visa-renewal">https://latintravelguide.com/colombia/tourist-visa-renewal</a></h3>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Medellín…the promised land of travelers at the moment.  It has become one of the new top digital nomad capital’s, according to some recent polls. Nicknamed the “City of Eternal Spring” for its perfect weather, Medellín is a place you can walk around in shorts &amp; sandles (although I was one of the rare men brave enough to not care about fashion &amp; have this tropical-beach-guy look. Most guys wear jeans, which I abhore, especially in hot weather!).  Medellín, is Colombia’s second largest city at around 3 million peeps. It is the capital of the mountainous Antioquia province, formerly made famous by the likes of Pablo Escobar &amp; his Medellin drug cartel. Long gone are the days when this city was one of the most dangerous in the World. Now, with the recent peace agreements with the rebel FARC &amp; ELN groups, the times are a changin’!  The people in this region, who refer to themselves as “paisa’s”, are proud of their heritage.  They are known to be some of the friendliest people in Colombia &amp; come from a long line of entrepreneurial hard working folks that take pride in their modern ways.  Here in Medellin, you will see no colonial cobblestone streets or early Spanish colonial buildings because they were torn down &amp; paved over long ago in the quest to modernize! You will, on the other hand, benefit from the metro system &amp; metro-cable cars that link the city to surrounding barrios and offer amazing views! You will find a pocket of history in the Centro barrio, with a few nineteenth century churches, museums &amp; the likes. Medellin is bursting with energy, culture, and modern amenities.  Enjoy!</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Top 3 places that are must-see in Medellín ::</strong></h3>
<h3>1. <span style="color: #333333;">Parque Arvi – ride the cable car soaring above the barrios of the North, switch to another one &amp; all the sudden you feel 100km away from Medellin as you zip through the forest for a 15 minute ride through the forests to Parque Arvi!  Do the guided 3hr hike for only 5,000pesos (less then $2usd).</span></h3>
<h3>2. Comuna de 13 tour – more on that below. A must!</h3>
<h3>3. Botanical Garden – muy linda&#8230;very beautiful!</h3>

<h3><strong>How to Renew Your Colombian Tourist Visa:</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>There are two ways to extend the initial 90 day tourist visa to reach the 180 day limit. One way is to leave the country, for example, by traveling by road to Ecuador or Venezuela. When you re-enter Colombia you will simply be issued with another 90 day tourist visa. The alternative method of visa renewal is to apply for one at the local office of Immigration Affairs (IA). A branch of IA is located in each of the county’s major cities. In <a href="https://latintravelguide.com/bogota">Bogota</a>, the office is situated at Calle 100 #11-27, and in <a href="https://latintravelguide.com/medellin">Medellin</a> the address is Calle 19 #80A – 40, Barrio Belén. A full list of centers is available via the <a href="http://www.migracioncolombia.gov.co/">immigration office’s website</a>.</h3>

					<h3><span class='et-dropcap'>C</span>uba is the place to go. When? NOW! I’m sure you’ve heard the buzzword phrase “I have to go before it changes!” Well, that’s probably true! It&#8217;s affordable (for now), culturally rich, and the people and food are amazing.  Most importantly, you CAN still go to Cuba! For Americans reading this, I repeat: It’s OK to visit Cuba! Even with Trump’s new restrictions, a full tour is not the only way to do it. There are many options that are cost-effective and flexible on the ground in Cuba. Reach out to a specialist for advice, compare options, read the regulations, talk to friends who have gone, but ultimately, go ahead and go. It is worth it!</h3>

<h3>Arriving to Havana &amp; settling into Habana Vieja (Old Town) was at first an assault on my senses. It is crowded, much hustle &amp; bustle, extremely loud &amp; overall quite a contrast to my countryside home I had left in Maui, Hawaii. Actually, after 3 weeks here I was still not acclimatized to the amount of people &amp; traffic, the extreme hot &amp; humid weather (of all the months I had to pick July!). That said, I found my havens &amp; an oasis here &amp; there. Many were on the rooftop bars where one can lounge around &amp; sip pina coladas from full hallowed out pineapple shells &amp; watch the sunset while listening to an amazing live salsa band or DJs. Others, were restaurants that offer AC, wi-fi &amp; occasionally the rare vegetarian food options that were hard to find in Cuba. Music, is of course our main focus here at Remix The Earth. Below you will find the best music &amp; nightlife options in Havana. In Habana Vieja it’s incredibly easy to find live music from noon to 11pm as its spilling out of all the tourist restaurants &amp; bars, local dives &amp; on the streets every few blocks, but generally it’s the same salsa over &amp; over….&amp; over. After the 5<sup>th</sup> day of that, I went looking for something else. Below we will give you more options including a weekly Rumba street party not to be missed, a weekly DJ rooftop bar night with two up &amp; coming female House DJs I had the honor of sharing the stage with, and more!</h3>

<h3>“Access to culture was a principal pillar of the communist system Fidel Castro installed in Cuba. Theatre and dance were given to the masses for almost nothing. Spilling out of cafes and blasting from cars, music is a backdrop to daily life in Cuba. On weekends, plazas are crammed with bands and dancers showing off their salsa moves.”  (National Geographic)</h3>

<h3>“Among younger generations, the music scene has taken a turn toward house and electronica. When Major Lazer played a show in Havana in 2016, half a million people showed up. Underground DJs like Joan Coffigny and the female duo Pauza spin at clubs like the Fabrica Arte Cubano and house parties. Havana’s first independent electronic music studio was started by DJ Ra. But a lack of basic supplies introduces new twists for the island’s innovators: a few summers ago recording artists found the island had run low on CDs.” (National Geographic)</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>:: Music Scene :: </strong></h2>
<h3></h3>
<h3><strong>Fabrica de Arte Cubana, aka F.A.C. &#8211;  </strong>Location: Off Linea Ave in Vedado barrio of Havana.  This place is very impressive! Fabrica de Arte is essentially a music venue, art gallery, and bar that is all built inside of an old olive oil factory. It has two floors plus an additional back area made from cargo containers. On the first floor is a bar, artwork and a live band playing, and upstairs is more art, a room where DJ’s &amp; bands play, and a back area where an indie film is playing on a massive screen. Out back is a patio where most people lounge and hang out, then back downstairs out back is a little “food truck” type thing made from one of the cargo containers with modern Cuban cuisine. If you continue walking past that you’ll see another bar, &amp; then you’ll pass through the doors that lead into the nightclub area where there’s more live music &amp; tons of people dancing every Thursday-Sunday night. It’s a must-see for every nightlife lover! Only 2 C.U.C. (about $2.10usd) cover charge any night &amp; cheap drinks makes it super affordable for most people. Great mix of locals &amp; travelers.</h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3><strong>EF3 &#8211;  </strong>Location: Calle 23 y Calle F, Vedado, Havana. Open til 3am.  This bar became a frequent stop for me &amp; my local friends. They consistently have amazing live bands, DJs accompanied by latin percussionists &amp; a mix of travelers &amp; locals.  I saw a great band that had an original style of Latin, Funk, Hip-Hop fusion play one night.  No cover charge.</h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3><strong>Roma &#8211; </strong>Location: Calle Augacate 162, Habana Vieja.  This rooftop bar has DJ’s spinning tunes 7 nights a week. It’s kind of a secret gem as it’s a bit tricky to find with no sign down below. There is an old elevator &amp; man that will guide you up to the bar, kind of like a speakeasy from the old days. They are the only bar that plays music until about 3am, &amp; this is perhaps why it’s a secret, as Habana Vieja has laws for music stopping at 11am. Rebels in a rebel country!</h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3><strong>Flauta Magica &#8211;  </strong>Location: Directly across from the American Embassy is a blue condo. On the 10<sup>th</sup> floor of that, the penthouse suite, lies a restaurant &amp; rooftop bar with an amazing sunset view of the Malecon Oceanside. Every Sunday from 4pm-Midnight features the female DJ duo Pauza, comprising of Zahira Sanchez and Paula Fernandez. The pair have attracted devoted fans that follow their shows across Havana. Styles of music = mostly Deep House, Minimal House, House music in general.  I had the honor of playing at this party &amp; wow&#8230;what a great place to watch sunset!  Strange the American Embassy was so close.  Felt like they were spying on us!</h3>

<h4></h4>
<h3><strong>Café Escorial &#8211; </strong>Location:Plaza Vieja in Habana Vieja  This café is on one of the corners of Plaza Vieja &amp; tends to have great live music practically every night of the week. Follow the sound of the Salsa &amp; Rumba till you make it upstairs. Then, grab a seat on the patio overlooking the Plaza, order a mojito &amp; sit back &amp; get ready to bob your head to the beat! I saw an 8 piece all female salsa band called 8 Tone that was fantastico!</h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3><strong>La Zorra y El Cuervo &#8211; </strong>Location: Vedado neighborhood in Havana.  Here you can find world class jazz most nights of the year.</h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3><strong>Ambos Mundos Hotel &#8211; </strong>Location: Corner of Calle Obispo &amp; Mercaderes Ave.  This is the famous hotel that Ernest Hemingway himself once shacked up in &amp; hunkered down &amp; wrote some of his stories. The rooftop restaurant/bar has a stunning view worth coming back several times! This spot was a “date place” for this single ready to mingle guy! Had a few pina coladas served in big pineapples. Not really a live music place from what I can tell, but great for drinks, food &amp; the view!</h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3><strong>Casa de Africa &#8211; </strong>Location: Habana Vieja, near Plaza Vieja.  Great place for Afro-Cuban cultural events. 2<sup>nd</sup> Saturdays of the month they have a big music &amp; dance performance not to be missed!</h3>

<h3><strong>Which neighborhoods to stay?</strong></h3>
<h3><strong><br />
</strong>Easy answer…..Old Town, Havana Vieja, duh!!!  It’s the oldest part of town, the Heart of Havana, with colonial buildings, cobblestone streets, a few plazas, museums &amp; Salsa bands on every block, with many choices of restaurants &amp; few rooftop bars!  Trust me, this neighborhood is the spot!  And yes&#8230;.Cuba has AirBnb now, although I believe it is only allowed for approved familes that run &#8220;casa particular&#8217;s&#8221;, a Cuban BnB that is monitored &amp; taxed heavily by the Cuban authorities.  Bring your passport for check in!</h3>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>:: HAVANA FOOD WISDOM revealed ::</strong></h2>
<h3></h3>
<h3><strong>Peso food &#8211; </strong>Peso food are meals that are available from little shops, around the country, which accept CUP (the National Peso currency). These foods are unbelievably affordable, and if you’re a traveler on a tight budget, you can easily get by on US $3 a day while still treating yourself to three full meals a day. That’s right – peso food is often a buck a plate (sometimes less). Some foods that you can buy with CUP include: fresh fruit juice (US $0.04-$0.08), egg &amp; cheese sandwich (US $0.36), sugarcane juice (US $0.04), pork&amp; rice meal (US $1.50), pizzas (US$0.44 -$1.20), ice cream cone (US $0.04), coffee (US $0.04), beer (US $0.50) and fruit &amp; vegetables from the market.</h3>

I have mixed feelings about this. My first impression: Wow! Fidel, Che &amp; about 87 other armed revolutionaries were able to mobilize beginning in 1953 &amp; actually won a civil war against all odds! Pre-1959 this was a country that was being taken over by American businesses, mafia, drugs &amp; corrupt politicians like there was no tomorrow. It was basically an American empire takeover (as seen on TV) by eager companies trying to get a slice of the Cuban pie. So, Fidel &amp; the new regime kicked out American companies, which is the nature of ‘nationalizing’ industries &amp; by 1962 Kennedy began the embargo against Cuba that is still operating. Many things here can be seen as positive change to this day: FREE Health Care, FREE Universtiy, FREE or extremely cheap Housing, &amp; FREE rations of food. The basics in life, all FREE!   That said, all workers work for the State. Everybody, including lawers &amp; doctors, make $40 a month or less. The only way around that is if you are very lucky enough to have one of the 30 government approved businesses such as: taxis, bicycle taxis, shops, restaurants, hair salons, etc.</h3>
<h3>I’ve heard that these businesses pay A LOT of taxes where they generally have no chance of getting much ahead. Such is communism: the limit of capitalism &amp; free market with government owned only businesses, heavily taxed to pay for the free absolute BASICS. Well, that’s fine if the people were getting enough nutrition, but they mostly live on rice, beans, meat &amp; eggs, oh…and expresso! That’s fine if my friend in Havana could afford Pampers for his baby at $9usd a pack. That’s fine if you want to spend ¼ your monthly income on overpriced phone &amp; web cards. That’s fine if the average person could EVER afford a car (I hear those extremely lucky enough to have a classic American car had them passed down from inheritance). That’s fine if you never plan to leave the country (forgot about having money to ever go on vacation abroad, or even within your country). That’s fine if your higher dreams are not so important &amp; you can make peace with poverty. You know what…I do not think this is ‘fine’ at all! The situation needs to change drastically. The revolution was a success in so many ways, but these people are ready for a change. I see it in their eyes. I see it in the 1/20 people walking around with American flag clothes (very popular since Obama loosened things up in 2015). Maybe if Trump could continue on that path (or more likely, the next president), the people could afford to make just a few of their dreams or household needs come into existence. Until then, on a financial level, it looks bleak. Cuba is one of the poorest countries I’ve been to out of 35, but very, very rich in culture! “Hasta la victoria, siempre” translates to “until the victory, always”, but…what exactly is the victory at this point?</h3>

<h3><strong>Random Quotes for Cuba ::</strong></h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3>“It has fine fruits, new bugs, excellent microbes, &amp; stone floors in the bedrooms. It certainly has a sensation in store for the average American.” (Frederic Remington, 1899)</h3>
<h3>“ Many Cubans can&#8217;t get parts to fix the old American and Russian cars, but adding electronic entertainment is becoming popular. MP3 players and rear-facing cameras are common additions. The most famous symbol of Cuba’s embargo-innovation balancing act are the vintage American cars. Owners haven’t been able to acquire new parts since President Kennedy issued a trade embargo in 1962, so they have devised hacks to keep the cars running. Now, with new technology coming into the country, these old cars are being revamped with mini-DVD players and stereo systems that blast out oldies in Spanish and the latest American pop.”   (National Geographic)</h3>

					<h2><strong>The Ultimate Guide to Travel Insurance!</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>“Never travel without insurance. This was the first time I ever purchased travel insurance and I am so glad I did. A few weeks into my trip to Brazil, I fractured my ankle &amp; needed surgery. My travel insurance not only covered the hospital bills there, but the flights home to receive surgery from my preferred doctor.”<br />
John Rhodes, U.S. resident in Brazil</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Is Travel Insurance Worth It?</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Yes!  Well, maybe. If you have an accident, it pays for itself immediately &amp; is worth it, &amp; if you don’t…well, this is the nature of insurance.  It’s a gamble most travelers prefer not to risk.  I always get travel insurance, 100%.  Its very affordable (actually, ridiculously cheap!), covers you for travel delays/cancellations, lost or delayed baggage (I’ve used this 2x), stolen items (used this 1x), &amp; perhaps most important…it covers you for medical/dental emergencies (used many times)!  My two cents, don’t leave home without it folks!  Here are some things to consider first:</h3>
<h3>• What does your credit card cover? Some credit cards will offer basic travel insurance coverage such as baggage delay/loss, but never as much coverage as a separate travel insurance policy will cover. Know your facts!</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>• How expensive is your trip? If you’ve spent thousands on your trip, you should cover your back &amp; have a good travel insurance policy to protect your flights, hotels &amp; car rental. Makes sense right? This is what insurance is for folks.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>• Are you traveling abroad? Travel insurance while abroad is crucial as your normal healthcare insurance is not going to cover you. Get a policy for emergencies when traveling abroad. Again, essential! Duh!</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>What Does Travel Insurance Really Cover?</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>First things first: Travel insurance is not medical insurance.</h3>
<h3>Medical coverage is an important part, but “travel insurance” breaks down into three broad areas of coverage:</h3>
<h3><strong>1. Medical &#8211; </strong>hospital bills, dental emergency, ambulance, evacuation &amp; repatriation expenses.</h3>
<h3><strong>2. Property</strong> &#8211; baggage or personal item loss/delay covers lost, stolen, or damaged goods.</h3>
<h3><strong>3. Travel</strong> &#8211; trip cancellation/delays/changes: accommodation and trip expenses.<br />
As a music producer and digital nomad, I carry a lot of expensive gear with me when I travel. This includes: a laptop, iPad, microphones, DSLR camera, external harddrive, iPhone 6S, etc. I can rest assured that if my goods are lost, stolen or damaged…I will get reimbursed!</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><em><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Travel insurance is important, and you need it!  In some cases, it’s even mandatory…such as work and holiday visas, or studying abroad. Don’t take the risk folks. Sign up today.</em></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Still not sure if you want to invest in travel insurance for your trip?   <em>Watch this:</em></h3>

<h2><strong>So, what are the best travel insurance companies?</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>World Nomads vs. Travel Guard vs. Allianz</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>World Nomads:</strong>  I’ve used World Nomads before &amp; had good customer service with them.  Where World Nomads shines is for adventure seekers.  Their medical expenses coverage provides for accidents while taking part in more than 100 different sports and physical activities.  According to their website, they offer “travel insurance for independent travelers and intrepid families.  World Nomads travel insurance has been designed by travelers for travelers, to cover your trip essentials.  Even if you run out of travel insurance or leave without it, World Nomads can cover you.  If want to travel longer, World Nomads lets you buy more coverage to keep you on the road.  Travelers, you can buy insurance even after you have already started your trip, with just one click online.”</h3>
<h3><em> *Note that they do not cover pre-existing medical conditions.</em><br />
Price per 1 year policy = $1274 standard or $1617 full coverage.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Allianz:  </strong>I am currently traveling with an Allianz policy. By far the cheapest comprehensive travel insurance policy out there at $201 a year for their Classic<br />
Plan + that is good for $1million coverage that includes the following:</h3>
<h3>* Existing Medical Condition Coverage.<br />
* Travel insurance is provided, at no extra cost, to children who are under 18 years of age on the date of purchase of insurance and who are accompanied by their parent(s) or traveling with just their grandparent(s).<br />
* Emergency Medical and Dental Benefits with no deductible.</h3>

<h3><strong>Travel Guard:</strong>  A few years back I used Travel Guard for my travel insurance while in on a 14 month around the world trip to India, Nepal, Europe &amp; Japan. They are not the cheapest, but have been in business for more than 20 years &amp; offer many extras. Travel Guard serves more than 6 million travelers each year.  They offer some of the widest variety of coverage packages you’ll find online. Their comprehensive plans offer to insure kids under 18 at no extra cost.</h3>
<h3>Price = $1,776 for 1 year global travel insurance “Silver” policy was the quote it gave me with my details. Pretty pricey, but that does include these extra coverages when the policy is purchased within 15 days of Initial Trip payment:</h3>
<h3>-Pre-Existing Medical Condition Exclusion Waiver when coverage is purchased within 15 days of Initial Trip Payment. (Limitations apply)<br />
-Trip Cancellation and Interruption coverage due to Financial Default of an airline, cruise line, or tour operator.<br />
-$25,000 in Flight Guard® Coverage<br />
AND these as well ::</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Travelex:</strong> I have not personally used this company yet but they have been gaining some love with the travelers the past few years. They offer a basic multi-trip policy for $390year with my credentials (it’s going to be a little different based on your age &amp; extras).</h3>

					<h3>I recently visited Puerto Rico for my first time with my old college buddy, Mattius. We rented an AirBnB in San Juan about a 10 minute taxi ride from San Juan Viejo, Old Town. Uber is now in Puerto Rico, so those who know the hassle of a gringo trying to constantly negotiate a fair price in regular taxi’s trying to overcharge you 2x-3x will be Uber-happy to know it exists there! For a 15-20 minute Uber it was averaging about $5-6.   Old Town is indeed where most of the action is, so point your inner-adventurer compass there! During the day, you have many choices of museums, the old “Morro” Spanish fort, &amp; an abundance of options to enjoy this colorful Caribbean ancient town. The word “colorful” does not do this place justice &amp; cannot come close to explaining it with words. Instead, let’s say its: a collage of pastels, tropical tastes, mesmerizing blends of animated architectural beauty. Now, let us get to the point, afterall, this is a travel music blog, where music is the main focus! During the night, woo-laa…you have plenty of music options right within Old Town, with my favorite, La Placita not far from there.</h3>
<h3><strong>1) La Placita  </strong></h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Recommended by several locals, this place kept popping up in conversational radars about the best nightlife in the city. We went out on a Thursday night &amp; were not disappointed. My bar is set very high for totally amazing nightlife places as I’ve recently spent two months in Rio de Janeiro, where I witnessed &amp; partied with the best of them for Carnaval the entire month of February 2017! See my blog <strong>here </strong>where I revealed the best of Samba street party culture there, with over 500+ “blocos” (themed block parties) that happen those 4 weeks! La Placita had the energy of Rio’s block parties, minus the numbers &amp; bands playing in the streets. It was a bit more contained inside about 15 different bars, but sometimes spilling out into the streets. There were live salsa bands that were top notch, perhaps rivaling Cuba’s bands I saw in Havana (click <strong>here </strong>for that blog adventure). One bar we went into was packed full of people, possibly 80 or so in the tiny place, and upon looking around, we noticed everybody there was above 60 years old &amp; dancing freely to a live obviously well known salsa band (we didn’t catch their name). Around the corner, there was another bar with a live salsa band, again the place packed full of people doing the highly energetic salsa boogie! Walking around more we felt like this place had it all. There are places with DJ’s spinning Reggaeton, Cumbia, EDM &amp; Top 40 dance tracks. There are restaurants &amp; food vendors with tables &amp; seating on the streets outside of the bars. Just sitting down for awhile &amp; people watching was fun too, as there must have been over 1000 people in this 2 block radius happening place they call La Placita!</h3>

<h3><strong>2) La Factoria</strong></h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3>This bar is well known in San Juan Viejo (Old Town) &amp; gets quite busy Thursday, Friday &amp; Saturday nights. They feature mostly DJ’s, and some live bands. The first few rooms were smaller &amp; full of people drinking &amp; socializing. They had a 3<sup>rd</sup> room that they opened up at 10pm which was much larger &amp; had a DJ playing classic Rumba &amp; Cumbia tunes off his iPad. Behind him, there were bookshelfs full of vinyl records &amp; two turntables, so yes…they spin records here as well. I have a real soft spot for vinyl, as I’ve been collecting since 1995, and my father since 1960. It’s a nostalgic thing, plus it is analog technology, which is said to contain more musical aesthetic &amp; pleasure from listening then compressed mp3s of our digital age! Anyhow, around 11pm it started to get busy here. Feet &amp; hips soon began moving with fire, inna Latino stylee! Salsa, Merengue, Rumba, Cumbia, oh yeah!</h3>
<h3>PS. I hear they have a 4<sup>th</sup> big room that opens up later on the weekends.</h3>

<h3><strong>3) Saint Germain</strong></h3>
<h3>This 3 story abode has a restaurant for fine dining on the street level, a stylish bar on the 2<sup>nd</sup> level, and a rooftop bar as your prize for walking up 3 flights of stairs. Nice view, great drink menu, &amp; great place for a date with your sweety, or a rest amidst your San Juan Viejo walks! Try some rum cocktails, your in the Carribean afterall &amp; plenty of rum abode in these islands full of sugarcane.</h3>

<h3><strong>4) Nuyorican Café</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>5)</strong> <strong>Which neighborhoods to stay?</strong></h3>
<h3><strong><br />
</strong>Easy answer…..Old Town, San Juan Viejo, duh!!!  It’s the oldest part of town, the Heart of San Juan, with colonial buildings, cobblestone streets, a few plazas, museums &amp; Salsa bands on every block(just like Cuba!), with many choices of restaurants &amp; few rooftop bars!  Trust me, this neighborhood is the shiznit!</h3>

					<h3><span class='et-dropcap'>T</span>his was I, the Boogiemeister’s, first trip to NYC!  I went out every single night for 12 days to check out the nightlife in this amazing music scene, plus I had the honor of DJ’ing two fun events!  One was DJ’ing the annual Mermaid Parade after-party Saturday June 17th, the other gig was at the Monday night “Eso” weekly Latin/African/Global EDM night at Bembe in Brooklyn.  Good times all around!</h3>
<h3>The Mermaid Parade 2017 ::  NYC’s finest music &amp; art’s “Burning Man” tribe culture came together for this festive parade that had it all! Well, except good weather that day!  Last Saturday June 17th, I found myself attending this parade with 4 friends dressed to the nine’s in mermaid garb &amp; myself improvising with any merman-ish costume i could quickly throw together.  I was pleased to see the spirit of Burning Man costume &amp; art car culture fully alive &amp; thriving throughout the parade.  After it finished there was a block party with DJ Myk 2 Melo put on by the Junxion crew, complete with big soundsystem mobile &amp; school bus painted up quite nifty!</h3>

<h3><strong>Recommended Weekly Events ::</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Mondays = </strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>“Eso” weekly Latin/African/Global EDM night at Bembe in Brooklyn.</strong></h3>
<h3>Not a huge venue, but a laid back intimate affair, with a crowd full of people not shy about dancing! I got to practice some cumbia, cha cha &amp; reggaeton dancing with some sweet senoritas from Mexico were visiting for the weekend. Many people in NYC I talked to about this venue had nothing but good things to say, especially for Monday nights if you like Latin music (both traditional &amp; Latin Electroinca like I played)!</h3>

<h3>“Fiery Balkan brass, throbbing funk grooves, Roma (Gypsy) accordion wizardry, and virtuoso jazz chops make Slavic Soul Party! NYC’s official #1 brass band for BalkanSoul GypsyFunk. SSP! pumps a strong Balkan brass sound through the filter of life in New York’s outer boroughs, making new music out of the unplanned results of immigration, proximity, and globalization. Over the past 15 years the band has released 7 full-length albums, and toured in the US, Canada, Mexico, Europe, Turkey, and Zimbabwe, from pasha’s palaces to dive bars, Carnegie Hall to Serbian schoolyards, festival stages to prison courtyards. The band’s music has fans on both sides of the Atlantic, and their tunes have been covered by Serbian brass stars, New Orleans funk stalwarts, and legendary street bands. SSP!’s Tuesday night residency in Brooklyn has become a destination for music fans from around the world, and is famous for “delivering a great time.” (New York Times)</h3>

<h2><strong>Other Events: </strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Ecstatic Dance NYC:</strong></h3>
<h3>held 1-2x a month on Sundays generally 6:30-11:30pm at the majestic Judson Church near Washington Park Square. This music event reached my top 3 dance experiences ever witnessed over 1000’s! For one, the beautiful stain glass historic church hall space with its high ceilings added a mystical/spiritual element to it all. This non-religious event attracted over 200+ frenzied dancers to unite in the name of “dance church” to move their bodies in unison like I had not seen before! The night began with yoga, then 2 DJ’s brought us into ecstatic dance formations indeed! The grand finale &amp; icing on the cake was a sound healing session with live crystal bowls, didgeridoo, Native American flutists walking around the room while we all layed down on our backs to decompress. I highly recommend checking out this truly unique event!</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ecstaticdancenyc/">https://www.facebook.com/ecstaticdancenyc/</a></strong></p>
<h3><strong>Make Music NYC: </strong>This annual festival I attended on Wednesday June 21<sup>st</sup> featured over 1000 bands, performers, DJs, dancers of all kinds all over NYC in over 100 locations! Best of all, it is FREE! Did you hear that? It is FREE !?$#%</h3>

For those that know how to tame it, the wild beast becomes their best friend, kind of like Jungle Book. I saw many people that seemed at home &amp; relaxed in this mega-urban-jungletropolis of LA. For those that cannot find their way to tame it, they get eaten up &amp; swallowed whole! I am guessing from the looks of it that most people probably fall into the later category. The question is, are they getting slowly consumed, or rapidly devoured…and, whether they know it or not. I witnessed the highest levels of extreme materialism, ego &amp; shallowness I’ve possibly ever encountered. I heard from many people about the parties they went to where people only talk to you if you’re a producer or musician. Its all about networking baby! Couple that with daily high anxiety ridden tense driving situations where EVERYBODY is constantly stuck in the bad habit of driving way too fast, 20-30mph over the speed limit. Everyday I drove past recent car wrecks, fender benders, &amp; looked around seeing scowling faces eager to honk their horns at the drop of a dime. For these two reasons: the people &amp; the traffic, LA does not make my top 100 choices of places to inhabit too long. I literally had culture shock coming straight from Maui where the community of people are known for their Aloha…&amp; drive with Aloha too! That means we very seldom honk (its considered rude in Hawaiian island culture), let other cars go in front of us at stops, honor their turn signals by letting cars change lanes (imagine that!), and most of all perhaps…honoring pedestrians rights to cross the street! LA, really does not seem so pedestrian friendly, say as they Bay Area with its Bart metro, or NYC with its amazing subway system. You really do need a car in LA, where as my favorite cities tend to be places you don’t. Think about it. That alone really changes a community. You really get more interactions, and a tighter knit community when people walk, talk, ride metro’s together. LA does have one, but its anything but connecting all the neighborhoods &amp; districts at the moment. Ok, ok.   I’ll admit it, I have a love-hate thing for big cities, &amp; it’s mostly hate after this week in LA. Hate, perhaps, is too strong of a word. I began to dislike LA for showing me her positive attributes last November &amp; luring me into her Cali charm: Venice Beach, Abbot Kinney district, Griffith Park, Topanga Canyon &amp; other magic places allured me into the idea of moving to LA &amp; leaving my precious Maui island lifestyle. My stuff is now in storage &amp; after about 1 year travels in South America working on this blog, I most likely will call Bay Area my new home instead.   My conclusion: There is an amazing &amp; epic music scene thriving in this mad city, with literally 100’s of live music venues, thousands of talented bands, &amp; every night of the week you have 20+ choices of good music shows! The restaurant choices as well are off the charts, with a ton of vegetarian/vegan options, international food, and always a heath food store deli nearby. This cannot be taken for granted as I’ve traveled many places around the US &amp; the Globe that just do not have many food choices. LA is a foodie &amp; music lovers paradise for sure! That said, after much thought…I decided overall I am more of a San Francisco or NYC kind of guy . Nevertheless, below are some of my favorite things about The City of Fallen Angels (ok, I need to stop being so harsh on LA now)!  <strong> </strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>:: Music Scene ::</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>El Rey Theatre &#8211;</strong> The El Rey Theatre is an original art deco theater in the heart of the Miracle Mile, one of Los Angeles&#8217; preserved art deco districts. The El Rey was built in 1936 and designed by Clifford Balch. After over 50 years as a first run movie house, the El Rey was converted into a live music venue in 1994. A registered Historic-Cultural Monument, the El Rey has sweeping staircases, an art deco lobby, VIP balcony lounge and a grand ballroom equipped with a full stage. The El Rey is a general admission, standing room venue, unless stated otherwise in specific show details. I saw the new NYC band Lewis Del Mar here in June 2017 &amp; had the time of my life!     <a href="http://remixtheearth.com/my-account/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.theelrey.com/events</a></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong> </strong><strong>Griffith Observatory &#8211; </strong><strong> </strong>Greek Theatre is a 5,870-seat music venue located at Griffith Park, Los Angeles, California. It was built in 1929, opening on September 29 of that year. The Greek Theatre is owned by the city of Los Angeles, and is operated by SMG.  My friend invited to me see Elvis Costello there live.  Not my favorite music exactly, but the venue is stellar!  World class actually!</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Ecstatic Dance LA: </strong>This event takes place every Sunday for those inclined to dance at a non-bar event, meaning a drug &amp; alcohol free environment safe for all-ages. Ecstatic Dance is an event that is now orchestrated in over 300+ cities worldwide.  See <a href="http://www.EcstaticDance.org">www.EcstaticDance.org</a> for a full list of events. This Los Angeles event steadily gets 100+ ‘ecstatic’ dancers turning out weekly for a tribal celebration. Usualy the format begins with a little yoga to loosen those dancing muscles! Aferwards the DJ slowly brings up the tempo over the course of the next hour, then bringing it back down gradually to end with some live world &amp; meditation music, aka sound healing.   <a href="https://www.ecstaticdancela.com/">https://www.ecstaticdancela.com/</a></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>:: Places worth checking out ::</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Venice Beach:</strong> This place is world famous for its group of artists, musicians, musclemen, &amp; total characters that hang out here for decades giving it its unique blend of charisma. Couple that with its natural beach beauty of never ending sand &amp; the sea &amp; you have the best of both worlds indeed! Good restaurants, 100’s of souvenir shops, street musicians &amp; artist vendors galore &amp; you have one of LA’s must-see places to check out on your visit. I recommend renting a bike &amp; bicycling the boardwalk bikeway from Venice to Santa Monica (about 30-45 minutes roundtrip). This is sunny California at its best, on a good day!</h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3><strong>Abbot Kinney district: </strong>Abbot Kinney street &amp; neighborhood is comprised of many hip cafes, shops, restaurants, a bars that give it a real cozy Cali vibe where fashion meets the beach culture. Great assortment of shops that will keep even this “non-shopper” busy looking around. I heard a legend that there is a rooftop bar at Hotel Erwin, but I did not get a chance to check it out. That’s because I was too busy checking out these!</h3>
<h3><strong> </strong></h3>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>:: Rooftop Bars of LA ::    </strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What is it that they say about smog? Oh yeah, <a href="http://www.timeout.com/los-angeles/shopping-style/fashion-and-style-las-most-stylish-outdoor-spots">beautiful sunsets</a>. Make L.A.&#8217;s haze work for you at these <a href="http://www.timeout.com/los-angeles/bars/cocktails-in-los-angeles">cocktail bars</a> and beachside spots, where the views rightfully rival the booze. From <a href="http://www.timeout.com/los-angeles/bars/the-best-downtown-los-angeles-bars">Downtown</a>&#8216;s bars with a view to seaside cabanas in Malibu and Venice, here are the city&#8217;s top (literally) rooftop bars.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Mama Shelter:</strong> The bright space is splattered with multicolored sofas and chairs where you can lounge while waiting for shawarma to arrive; the Mediterranean-inspired menu also serves falafel, salmon skewers and a few hummus options. Cocktails also pay tribute to the Mediterranean, with drinks like the Za&#8217;atar Margarita and Mediterranean Mule. On warm nights, you can dance under the stars while DJs spin an eclectic mix of music, or take in a classic movie on their outdoor screen. There&#8217;s also a fusbol table, a yoga studio and sweeping views of Hollywood.</h3>

<h3></h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3><strong>Standard Downtown: </strong>Even if you don’t hop in the pool, you can still plunge into the fun on one of the bright red waterbed pods scattered across the roof at the Downtown outpost of Andre Balaz’s hip hotel. Take the elevator up to the top, where mod furnishings give a slightly space-age vibe—the perfect backdrop for a crowd ranging from folks waiting for next year’s Burning Man to hotel guests checking out the scene. Weekend afternoons call for cocktail lounging—try the sweet and sour Hennessy Lemonade—but beware the $20 cover after 7pm, which doesn’t deter the lines that can stretch out into the parking lot.  <a href="http://www.standardhotels.com/la/features/rooftop" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><a href='#' class='small-button smallblue'>Website</a> </a></h3>

<h3></h3>
<h3><strong>Upstairs: </strong>Look good—but not like you&#8217;re trying too hard—when visiting Upstairs, a Moroccan oasis perched atop the trendy Ace Hotel. The elevator next to L.A. Chapter is your key to getting inside (or rather, outside) the buzzing, open-air roof deck, swathed in an exotic canopy and scattered with hip Downtowners clutching plastic cups. Perfect for an after-work schmooze or a reunion with old friends, you&#8217;ll find two bars to order a drink from (be warned: weekends bring the requisite long lines). Try the Lefty Lucy, a surprisingly easy-to-drink concoction made with chile liqueur, peach liqueur, ginger, lime and yellow chartreuse.  LA&#8217;s favorite Monday night weekly dance party, MOM (Motown On Mondays), is known to do some fun music events here, as well as other DJ collectives &amp; bands.   <a href="https://www.acehotel.com/calendar/losangeles">https://www.acehotel.com/calendar/losangeles</a></h3>

<h3></h3>
<h3><strong>Perch LA: </strong>This rooftop bistro is one of the prettiest in town with its patterned tile floors, dead-on view of the Central Library and potted trees full of twinkly lights. Downtown locals, plus a few hundred of their closest friends, sit on velour bar stools and plush sofas inside the eclectic boudoir-themed bar or fireside on the outdoor patio. From any seat, you’ll want to sample the wide selection of Kirs that go beyond Crème de Cassis—try a tasty, blackberry-flavored Crème de Mure—and other French by-the-glass pours. The after-work crowd drops in for happy hour, dubbed Apéritif Hour, weekdays from 4 to 6pm, while late-night partygoers can enjoy a live DJ on Tuesdays from 9pm-2am.  <a href="http://perchla.com/calendar.html">http://perchla.com/calendar.html</a></h3>

<h3></h3>
<h3><strong>Sky Bar:   </strong>The rooftop bar that started it all, the Mondrian&#8217;s Skybar still retains its secret Sunset Strip entryway, complete with dress-to-impress entry and nightlife cred—this is one of the rare poolside bars where people really do jump in after a night of cocktails. The all-ages crowd ranges from wide-eyed ingénues to aging Robert Evans types, but no matter where you fall on the spectrum, the Mexican-style oasis of flowering walls and gorgeous nooks will win you over, especially with a mojito in hand.</h3>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>:: Vegan &amp; Vegetarian Restaurants ::</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>List of over 125 Vegetarian &amp; Vegan LA Restaurants!   <a href="https://www.happycow.net/north_america/usa/california/los_angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.happycow.net/north_america/usa/california/los_angeles/</a></h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3><strong>Gracias Madre: </strong></h3>
<h3>When it was announced that Café Gratitude was bringing vegan Mexican food to West Hollywood in the form of Gracias Madre, there may or may not have been a considerable amount of eye rolling, but some skeptics are probably believers now. The absence of traditional cheese also means an abundance of cashew &#8220;cheese&#8221; or cream, served over nachos, tacos, enchiladas, flautas and almost everything else on the menu. Fortunately, the next best thing is sometimes just as good. The <em>quesadillas de calabaza</em> are topped—but, thankfully, not drowned—in the faux dairy, and we fully enjoyed the sweet butternut squash and salty caramelized onions tucked inside the tortillas. The food here is a necessary reminder that vegan doesn&#8217;t have to mean void of flavor.</h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3><strong>Café Gratitude:</strong></h3>
<h3>Café Gratitude is the first Los Angeles outpost of a chain that claims seven Bay Area locations. And true to its flower-child roots, the items on its menu are given self-affirming names. Among them are I Am Thriving (butternut squash chipotle soup), I Am Elated (enchiladas), I Am Transformed (corn tacos) and I Am Extraordinary (&#8220;BLT&#8221; sandwich).</h3>
<h3>After several weeks of dining at Café Gratitude, one might find oneself Vibrant, Grounded, Whole, Loved, Magical, Precious and Cozy, but never Hung Over, Angry, Jealous, Hurt or Sorry. In fact, the restaurant is so uniformly bright and cheery that it borders on pathological. Think Disneyland gone vegan, sans the heartland tourists wearing fanny packs.</h3>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Which neighborhoods to stay?</strong></h3>
<h3><strong><br />
</strong>Los Angeles has many options.  Santa Monica, Venice Beach &amp; Abbot Kinney if you want to be near the beach action, Topanga Canyon if you prefer to be surrounded by lush hills of Nature (its about 15minute drive from Santa Monica on most days depending on traffic). Explore AirBnB &amp; check out the flats, views, artsy fartsy studios &amp; find one you desire.</h3>

					<h3>Maui. A legendary place that most people have heard of. Many people dream of coming here, but only see it in the movies. Others make it here for a week vacation, or a honeymoon, &amp; almost always…people come back. Some of us, like me, came here a few times &amp; decided to make the big move &amp; call it home. After 8 years of living on Maui, I can’t say I’ve had any regrets. I started an event production company &amp; organized over 50+ music events with live bands, DJ’s, live painters, dance performances, &amp; a VJ. We had a stellar jolly good time almost every show (often sold out!), as people love to get down on the islands! Compared to all the other islands, minus Oahu, Maui has got a lot going on for its size! Music events, theater, art galleries, DJ beach dance parties, silent headphone rave’s &amp; the annual Art=Mixx event that kind of sums it all up to let you know the verdict = MAUI IS NO KA OI (the best)!</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>:: Music Venues ::</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Charley’s:   </strong>142 Hana Hwy, Paia.   <a href='http://charleysmaui.com/' class='small-button smallblue' target="_blank">website</a> <a href="http://charleysmaui.com/"> </a></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>This place is a local legend in itself. Willie Nelson used to be co-owner before he sold his share. I saw him perform there once to a crowd of 200 of us lucky locals that got in! There are many good live bands &amp; DJ nights at this little joint located just a few hundred meters from the ocean in the little ole town of Paia. Its got a country &amp; western theme, but don’t let that fool ya…its more surfer-dude/beach-babe crowd then anything. One of my highlights here was November 2016 organizing the Charley 2na show (from Jurassic 5) to a sold out crowd! Mainly Fridays &amp; Saturdays for music events, as well as Monday open mic nights is where its at. As far as their food, they serve succulent sushi, burgers/fries, pizza, pasta &amp; have quite a good chef in the house always adding new delights to the menu. It’s a great place to just get a beer &amp; chill as well. Like Cheers…it is an ”everybody knows your name” kind of a bar.</h3>

<h3><strong>South Shore Tiki Lounge: </strong>1913 S Kihei Rd, Kihei.     <a href='http://www.southshoretikilounge.com/' class='small-button smallblue' target="_blank">website</a></h3>
<h3>This place is located in “The Triangle” – a place locals refer to because of 3 main music venues within a few hundred feet of each other (this one, Ambrosia + Threes). South Shore Tiki Lounge is a cute little Hawaiian themed restaurant with plenty of tiki torches &amp; a tropical vibe. There is an outdoor area with live music and an indoor area for dining as well. According to their website they offer this for you music lovers:<br />

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>:: Fun Things TO DO ::</strong></h2>
<h3>
<p>The best thing is to get the book: Maui Revealed &#8211; you can then locate the spots i mention below on their maps:</h3>
<h3>For jungle vibe and waterfalls:</h3>
<h3>One favorite place is 7 Sacred Pools in Kipahulu.  It is the most jungly area. If you camp at the park there you can go hike up across the street through a huge bamboo forest and see a great waterfall about 300 feet high!  Highly recommended!  About 45-60minute walk.</h3>
<h3>Twin Falls is amazing (touristy) but beautiful hike to different pools!</h3>
<h3>On the way to Hana there is a lot of nice views and great falls/pools,</h3>
<h3>Not to be missed:   Waiʻānapanapa State Park  &amp; Venus Pools!</h3>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>::  Which neighborhoods to stay? ::</strong></h2>
<h3></h3>
<h3><strong><br />
</strong>Maui has a few choices for you.  North Shore if your really into surfing &amp; the vibe of smaller old towns &amp; less resorts.  Westside near Lahaina &amp; Kaanapali if you prefer the 4 &amp; 5 star resorts &amp; high end AirBnB&#8217;s in that area.  Southside near Kihei or Makena/Wailea if your into the dry desert beach action over there.  Explore AirBnB &amp; check out the flats, studios, beach homes &amp; amazing Maui magic places you can stay!</h3>

<h3><strong>:: Camping options ::</p>
<p></strong></h3>
<h3>Camp Olowalu ::  best camping spot on island!  Cabins, Tents, Showers, Kayak rentals, car camping right on the beach!     <a href="https://www.campolowalu.com/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.campolowalu.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1504748142285000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF-lRWck1i-m5JkUnu1TEOXhDzpMA">https://www.campolowalu.com/</a></h3>
<h3><a href="http://www.alternative-hawaii.com/accom/mcccp.htm" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.alternative-hawaii.com/accom/mcccp.htm&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1504748142285000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFURdU7F6xeuSvtcMbYSBUCaHRCrg">http://www.alternative-hawaii.com/accom/mcccp.htm</a></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>There are only few places to camp on North Shore.  One is what people call &#8220;Airport Beach&#8221; as its literally minutes from the airport, official name is Kanaha Beach.  Totally free to stay there, no registration needed.  Its a mix of windsurfers/kite-surfers &amp; homeless people by the way, wouldnt leave any possessions in tent during day but tent should be fine. Lovely beach!</h3>
<h3>*my favorite camping is at 7 sacred pools area past Hana on ocean for $5 night (actually, you can show up past 6pm or so &amp; nobody there to collect, many do this, no worries).</h3>
<h3>**contact Maui state park office and rent a cabin in Wainapanapa State Park for about 40 bucks a night and they are pretty slick!</h3>
